    description: `While researching for Our Planet it was evident that most information available online about endangered animals was well represented, but tucked away and hidden. Our Planet makes use of a wealth of stunning photos in order to resonate with users in a more immediate way. It is my hope that you walk away with a greater awareness of the impact we have, as humans, to the other species that call this planet home.`,
    areaOfFocus: 'Our Planet is a web application built as part of the curriculum at Turing School of Software & Design. The project incorporates both a back-end database and a front-end user interface. The back-end repository was built using Node.js and Knex, while the front-end was constructed primarily through React and Redux. All styling was done through Sass and the testing suite runs through Enzyme and Jest.',

    title: 'Palette Picker',
    description: 'For the little scientist in all of us! Palette Picker is a progressive web app that allows users to save projects and palettes (read as: concoctions and goo) to a database for later access. The design concept is inspired by the immaginative doodles of children, using simple shapes and colors to bring the project to life. Built in jQuery, Node.js, and PostgreSQL.',
    areaOfFocus: `My area of focus for this project was on becoming more familiar with building schemas in Node.js, as well as more complex database endpoints and PostgreSQL commands. I also wanted to refresh my jQuery skills and become reacquainted with the library's unique DOM manipulation techniques. All of the graphics were specialy designed for this project as well, with inspiration coming from minimalist design that painted an imaginative picture with as little complexity as possible. The idea for a child's doodles came when I started to imagination the generation of colors as a mad scientist's experiment.`,

    description: 'Built using the Star Wars API as a study in asynchronous JavaScript with nested API calls. Leverages ES6 and hones in on best practices for complex functionality testing.',
    areaOfFocus: `The area of focus for SWAPI Box was to navigate around aynchronous JavaScript that had long load times, while still providing a tangible user experience. Efforts were made to break complex fetch requests into smaller pieces allowing large sets of data to arrive individually and load faster if the completed sooner.`,

    description: 'Uses The Movie Database API to show the twenty most recently released movies. Allows users to log in with a username and password as well as save favorite movies.',
    areaOfFocus: `Diving head first into Redux for the first time, my focus was to grapple with the way actions and reducers work with components and containers. A level of complexity was added by having to interact with a backend database to make GET, POST, and DELETE requests. I also made a huge effort to solify my testing capabilities through Jest and Enzyme, formulating comprehenzive checks for more complicated helper files and fetch requests.`,
